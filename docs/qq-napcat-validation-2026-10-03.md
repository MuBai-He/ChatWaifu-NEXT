# QQ NapCat validation — 2026-10-03

Implementation branch: `mubai/qq-napcat-integration`, based on `e609345`.
This is CW2 implementation evidence. It is separate from QQ Agent Plus comparison
results and from the concurrent search/answer evaluation.

## Verified software behavior

- QQ uses the existing external gateway, character, conversation and memory path.
- Only configured-owner private structured text is admitted. Pairing requires the
  exact one-time command; ordinary Chinese messages do not fail or establish pairing.
- Normal QQ replies have no tools or TTS. An explicit fresh voice request exposes
  only `channel.voice`, bound to the current session/turn/generation and fixed owner.
- Delivered speech is the canonical assistant text. Voice failure produces one
  truthful text fallback under plan version 2, retaining the failed audio evidence.
- Real local WebSockets and SQLite cover authentication, RPC correlation, timeout,
  cancellation during audio read/account preflight, disabled connections, account
  replacement, committed send fences, lost receipt persistence and restart replay.
- Settings recover from missing ephemeral pairing resources after restart, confirmed
  pairing versus cancel races, and failed connection refresh without showing stale
  healthy state.

The native packaging command `pnpm build` additionally attempted the unchanged
Rust shell and failed to load `thiserror_impl` from the local Cargo artifacts.
Native app packaging is not counted as a passed check. The Web and desktop UI
artifacts above built successfully; no Rust source was changed.

## Linux staging

The separate source is `/home/mubai/cw2-qq-napcat-stage/source`, with state in
`/home/mubai/.local/share/chatwaifu-qq-stage`. The new user service
`chatwaifu-qq-stage.service` binds `127.0.0.1:8771`. Authenticated health and
provider discovery returned HTTP 200, and discovery contains `qq_napcat`.
The separate static Web service binds `127.0.0.1:18781` and returned HTTP 200.
An authenticated invalid pairing request returned HTTP 422 without echoing the
submitted token. The original Runtime service remained active throughout the
staging restart.
These are separate from the existing Runtime/search test environment.

Staging uses its own Python executable and source paths, with a read-only
site-packages reference to the existing test server dependency environment.
A fresh full frozen dependency installation timed out while fetching PyPI
artifacts, so clean Linux installation is not claimed. Pytest and pytest-asyncio
are installed only in the staging environment.

Staging now uses the existing server's current OpenAI-compatible chat parameters
and the corresponding chat credential, copied into its own configuration. The
original database has no `budget_json` column; the current protocol default budget
was validated/generated while retaining its 65,536-token context window. No live
chat inference was invoked. Memory extraction/summary remain deterministic demo,
and embedding remains local-hash for this transport/voice staging acceptance.

The separate `chatwaifu-qq-stage-tts.service` binds `127.0.0.1:8773`, uses a new
worker credential, and returned authenticated health/capability HTTP 200; requests
without credentials return HTTP 401. Its vendor code/configuration, working
directory, output and Python/Numba/HuggingFace/Torch caches are independent.
Model weights and reference audio are read from existing resources. User-service
read-only mount enforcement was not confirmed; the evidence relies on isolated
write paths and before/after resource hashes, not a verified OS sandbox.
Proactive tasks, wake phrases and resource sleep are disabled for staging.

One actual local GPT-SoVITS synthesis passed through this branch's Runtime TTS
adapter: 1,440 ms, 32,000 Hz mono PCM16 WAV, 92,204 bytes, non-silent samples and
valid RIFF frames; cold synthesis took 21.872 seconds. Evidence and the audio are
in `/home/mubai/cw2-qq-napcat-stage/validation/REAL-VOICE-ACCEPTANCE.json` and
`real-voice-smoke.wav`. This test made no chat-model or QQ calls and does not
establish phone playback, voice similarity, or real-model answer quality.

After synthesis, all three original services retained their process IDs/start
times; all 22 captured model/reference/vendor-configuration hashes were unchanged,
as were the original worker's loaded state and empty queue. No original Python
cache files had timestamps modified since staging configuration began. This cache
check is a timestamp inventory, not a full dependency-cache before/after hash.
Non-secret result evidence is under staging `worker/evidence/`. All 1,442 deployed
tracked source files also matched the implementation source manifest.

## Pending real-account acceptance

NapCat v4.18.28 is running and healthy in `cw2-qq-stage-napcat-napcat-1`.
All seven compressed layers and the image configuration matched the official
amd64 manifest before offline loading. The container uses immutable image ID
`sha256:dc4600051247e5716c9ea0db2a0b057a2357ff79d5ea383ba33ae1335ebbeeb7`.
WebUI `/webui/` returned HTTP 200. Docker binds only `127.0.0.1:16099` and
`127.0.0.1:13001`; the latter still needs account-specific OneBot configuration.
Non-secret provenance and deployment checks are recorded in
`/home/mubai/cw2-qq-napcat-stage/napcat/IMAGE-PROVENANCE.json` and
`DEPLOYMENT-ACCEPTANCE.json`. Existing container identities, start times and
restart counts were unchanged.
No QQ account has been logged in, paired, or sent a real test message by these checks.

Remaining acceptance: role QQ login, exact owner pairing, ordinary text then an
explicit voice request then ordinary text again, real phone playback, denied
senders/groups/media, interruptions, transport reconnect, Runtime restart, and
an actual send/receipt interruption window. Chat inference, real character-voice
quality and long-term memory behavior still need their own acceptance.
